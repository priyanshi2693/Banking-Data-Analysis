🏦 Banking Data - Decision Tree Classifier
📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies, where I implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer outcomes based on banking data.

🎯 Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Scikit-Learn (Decision Tree Model)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

📊 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
✅ Model Training – Built a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-Learn.
✅ Evaluation Metrics – Assessed model performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
✅ Feature Importance – Identified key factors influencing customer decisions.
